# Campsite Availability Scraping

This script scrapes the https://recreation.gov website for campsite availabilities.

## Example Usage
```
$ python camping.py --start-date 2018-07-20 --end-date 2018-07-23 --parks 232448 232450 232447 232770
‚ùå TUOLUMNE MEADOWS: 0 site(s) available out of 148 site(s)
üèï LOWER PINES: 11 site(s) available out of 73 site(s)
‚ùå UPPER PINES: 0 site(s) available out of 235 site(s)
‚ùå BASIN MONTANA CAMPGROUND: 0 site(s) available out of 30 site(s)
```

You can also read from stdin. Define a JSON file (see example in campsites/) and then use it like this:
```
$ python3 camping.py --nights 2 --parks_file campsites/park_ids.json
```

You'll want to put this script into a 5 minute crontab. You could also grep the output for the success emoji (üèï) and then do something in response, like notify you that there is a campsite available. See the "Twitter Notification" section below.

## Number of nights
If you're flexible on travel dates, you can search for a specific number of contiguous nights within a wide range of dates. This is useful for campgrounds in high-demand areas (like Yosemite Valley) or during peak season when openings are rare. Simply specify the `--nights` argument. For example, to search for a 5-day reservation in the month of June 2020 at Chisos Basin:
```
$ python camping.py --start-date 2020-06-01 --end-date 2020-06-30 --nights 5 234038
There are campsites available from 2020-06-01 to 2020-06-30!!!
üèï CHISOS BASIN (BIG BEND) (234038): 13 site(s) available out of 62 site(s)
```

## Getting park IDs
What you'll want to do is go to https://recreation.gov and search for the campground you want. Click on it in the search sidebar. This should take you to a page for that campground, the URL will look like `https://www.recreation.gov/camping/campgrounds/<number>`. That number is the park ID.


## Installation

@banool wrote this in Python 3.7 but tested it as working with 3.5 and 3.6 also.
```
python3 -m venv myvenv
source myvenv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
# You're good to go!
```

## Development
This code is formatted using black and isort:
```
black -l 80 --py36 camping.py
isort camping.py
```
Note: `black` only really supports 3.6+ so watch out!

## Twitter Notification
If you want to be notified about campsite availabilities via Twitter (they're the only API out there that is actually easy to use), you can do this:
1. Make an app via Twitter. It's pretty easy, go to: https://apps.twitter.com/app/new.
2. Change the values in `twitter_credentials.py` to match your key values.
3. Pipe the output of your command into `notifier.py`. See below for an example.

```
$ python3 camping.py --nights 2 --parks 233116 | python3 simple-notifier.py tweet

$ python3 camping.py --nights 2 --parks_file campsites/park_ids.json | python3 simple-notifier.py tweet
```

Optionally, you can tag a user at the end, e.g. `python3 ... tweet @EmpedadorBeto`

You'll want to make the app on another account (like a bot account), not your own, so you get notified when the tweet goes out.

## Notes 2020-06-24

They changed the API. There is this search endpoint that enables you to see how many sites are available in a date range, but this wouldn't be compatible with the `--nights` feature.

```
https://www.recreation.gov/api/search?fq=asset_id%3A231946&start=0&start_date=2020-07-14T00%3A00%3A00.000Z&end_date=2020-07-17T00%3A00%3A00.000Z&include_unavailable=true

            "availability": "available",
            "availability_counts": {
                "Available": 27
            },
```
## Our Features / To Do

* Integrate with our Twitter notifications ‚úÖ
* If no start or end date given, then default to today + 6 months as time range ‚úÖ
* Output which dates are available for given site numbers ‚úÖ
* 1.0 - update the static file to read from with all campground ids of interest. 2.0 - read campground ids from Google Doc instead of static file
* Half Dome permits: https://www.recreation.gov/api/permits/234652
